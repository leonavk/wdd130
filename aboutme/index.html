        Hello, my name is Leona. I am a wife, mother and constant learner. I originate from a small island in the South Pacific, Tonga. I moved here when I was 5 and have lived in California most of my life. I now reside in Fort Worth, Texas. I have been married for 25 years this November. My husband and I have 6 children ranging from 23 years-8 years old. Here is a picture of my family.

        I am taking this course in hopes of earning a Bachelors in Applied Technology. I am very foreign to this course and will need more help than anyone else in the class. I am hopeful and pray that I could sincerely understand the material. I wish you all best of luck as we learn together to program.
